A place where I can practice my HTML and CSS skills while creating a resume 

I decided to create this as extra practice during the HTML and CSS unit of my Perscholas SWE bootcamp

This will grow and change
- the first phase is just the important resume information displayed on the page, and a way for me to practice adding headings, paragraphs, sections, lists, images, links, and more in HTML 
- Second phase will be changing the styling using CSS to create a page that is easy to read 
- Third Phase will be adding a menu and sections or tabs so that it is easier to read, and allows me to add more information like an about me section with more personal information/a longer about me, and sections for things like projects  

<!-- important note- the logo.html document is an in-class practice -->
