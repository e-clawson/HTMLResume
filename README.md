# About
A place where I can practice my HTML and CSS skills while creating a resume 

I decided to create this as extra practice during the HTML and CSS unit of my Perscholas SWE bootcamp.

However, I ended up using it as a starting point for my HTML/CSS Skills based assessment. 

# Requirements

"This SBA will test your skills in creating a simple website with a clean layout and styling. Your website should have a well-developed HTML structure and follow good visual design methodologies in order to produce a satisfying user experience."

For this project we were required to create a three-page website with the following minimum requirements: 
- 3 pages 
- 1 table 
- 2 forms
- 1 dropdown menu
- 1 of each:
    - text
    - images
    - gif 
- Inline, internal, and external styling
- 5 different CSS selectors 
- colors that compliment each other
- use flexbox and/or bootstap grid 
- at least two CSS transitions 

# Reflection 

- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

- Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

- What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?

- Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
