A place where I can practice my HTML and CSS skills while creating a resume 

I decided to create this as extra practice during the HTML and CSS unit of my Perscholas SWE bootcamp

This will grow and change - below are my planned phases for development, which will likely change as I work through the project: 

- Phase 1 - Getting the important resume information displayed on the page, and a way for me to practice adding headings, paragraphs, sections, lists, images, links, and more in HTML. I will also practice HTML Text formatting Elements in this phase, but may end up changing the styling using CSS in phase 2 

- Phase 2 - Practicing my styling using CSS to create a better styled page that is easier to read. This phase will also likely require me to clean up my HTML code and ensure i'm using best practices so that I can best isolate parts of the page to add styling. 

- Phase 3 - will be adding a menu and sections or tabs so that it is easier to read, and allows me to add more information like an about me section with more personal information/a longer about me, and sections for things like projects
